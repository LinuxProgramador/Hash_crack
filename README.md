Note: (bcrypt/sha256crypt/sha512crypt/ripemd-160/wpa-psk) are slow hashes, that's why the decryption time tends to be longer 

Installation:

    cd ~

Important Notes: 

1- If you want to use your own dictionary, you should name it wordlist.txt and place it in the Hash_crack directory.

2- Success in cracking passwords from ZIP and RAR files depends heavily on the program used to compress them. Decryption is more likely to work if they were compressed using console tools such as zip or rar.

Quit the program:

Press CTRL + C
