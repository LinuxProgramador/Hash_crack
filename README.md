Important Notes: 

INFO: This tool was designed mostly for the Termux environment, since tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat are not compatible with Termux.

INFO: Argon2id is only available in single-core modules, for example (Hasher / Brute_force)

INFO: Scrypt is only available in single-core modules, for example (Hasher / Brute_force)

1- If you want to use your own dictionary, you should name it wordlist.txt and place it in the Hash_crack directory.

2- Success in cracking passwords from ZIP and RAR files depends heavily on the program used to compress them. Decryption is more likely to work if they were compressed using console tools such as zip or rar.

3- In "DCC2/WPA-PSK" hashes enter the user or SSID along with the hash:
For example: 

    WPA-PSK: MyNetwork:c5846b79d776cf7c0973edf6e8bb0778da330b1a92d18f6664557b1d9b7498dd

    DCC2: root:e7f9a1ba77b1d0406ab52783b2b9636a
